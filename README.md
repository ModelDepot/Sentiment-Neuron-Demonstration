# Sentiment Neuron

## Description
Detect a person's sentiment in text using Unsupervised Sentiment Neuron, a model trained on 82 million Amazon reviews. It's able to predict sentiment by taking in a string, and outputting the sentiment value from -1 to 1. The full text of the review is used to detect sentiment, so even if the sentiment switches mid-text, it'll still be detected.
